Here we will be planning to create the Library management software

Details to be noted are as follows :

1.Text File will store the name and details of all books

2.We will store all the info within a text (.txt) file in the local storage in Dictionary format(JSOn obj)

3.When the user clicks on a book_details button then he / she is shown a page consisting of all the details of a book that is read out aloud by the voice API if clicked on the read symbol.

Details of a book to be stored :

    1.name of the book.
    2.name of the author.
    3.book code.
    4.book price.
    5.number of copies.
    6.book genre.
    7.book overview.
    8.book publisher.
    9.availability
    10.borrowed_by(and student class section and roll)(In case the book is borrowed by a student)

4.Checks for an existing database for the library in case the app had been used first and was deleted by the user due to some reason.
